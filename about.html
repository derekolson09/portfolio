                <p>
                    I am a software developer for projects of any size. But not only that, I am also a pianist and
                    digital artist.
                    I have done extensive work in MSSQLServer, Python and Java. I have also worked with the webstack
                    (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and various frameworks therein.
                    To boil myself down to two adjectives, I am a problem solver and a creator.
